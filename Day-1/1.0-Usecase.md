### <span style="color:Yellow"> Company Background:  </span>

Contoso Electronics, a global leader in cutting-edge technology and consumer electronics, has been at the forefront of innovation for over three decades. Headquartered in the heart of Silicon Valley, Contoso Electronics is renowned for its commitment to excellence, quality, and customer satisfaction. With a diverse portfolio that spans smart home devices, wearable technology, advanced robotics, and AI-driven solutions, Contoso Electronics is dedicated to transforming the way people live, work, and play. 

  

### <span style="color:Yellow"> Use case:  </span>

To further enhance the employee experience, Contoso Electronics aims to develop an AI assistant named ContosoBuddy. This innovative AI assistant will help employees navigate HR, logistics, travel, and benefit-related questions with ease. ContosoBuddy will leverage advanced NLP and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate, timely, and personalized assistance, ensuring that employees have the support they need to thrive in their roles. 

ContosoBuddy will be particularly beneficial for new hires, serving as a mentor. By providing internal company information, ContosoBuddy will help new employees acclimate quickly and feel welcomed from day one. This will significantly reduce our HR and administrative tasks, allowing us to focus on our core strength—innovating and shaping the future. 

  

### <span style="color:Yellow"> Requirements: </span> 

As the first phase of this project, develop an end-to-end application solution to demonstrate how ContosoBuddy can provide employees with instant access to information and resources, particularly related to benefits. We aim to launch this AI assistant to address any benefit-related inquiries. Based on employee feedback and the overall progress of the AI, we will plan the next phase of this project to include company culture, policies, and other internal information.
