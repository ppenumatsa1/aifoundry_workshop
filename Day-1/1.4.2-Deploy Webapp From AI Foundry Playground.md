## Deploy the web app

Publishing creates an Azure App Service in your subscription. It might incur costs depending on the pricing plan you select. When you're done with your app, you can delete it from the Azure portal.

To deploy the web app:

> **Important**
> 
> You need to register Microsoft.Web as a resource provider before you can deploy to a web app.

1. Complete the steps in the previous section to add your data to the playground.

2. Select **Deploy > ...as a web app**.

3. On the **Deploy to a web app** page, enter the following details:

   - **Name**: A unique name for your web app.
   - **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription. If you don't see any available subscriptions, first register Microsoft.Web as a resource provider.
   - **Resource group**: Select a resource group in which to deploy the web app. Use the same resource group as the hub.
   - **Location**: Select a location in which to deploy the web app. Use the same location as the hub.
   - **Pricing plan**: Choose a pricing plan for the web app.
   - **Enable chat history in the web app**: Select chat history box. If you enable the feature, your users have access to their individual previous queries and responses. For more information, see chat history remarks.

4. Select **Deploy**.

5. Wait for the app to be deployed, which might take a few minutes.

6. When it's ready, the **Launch** button is enabled on the toolbar. But don't launch the app yet and don't close the chat playground page - you'll return to it later.


## Customizing the application using environment variables

To update the web app with chat history enabled:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select the App Services page.
2. Select the web app that you have just deployed.
3. In the left menu of the app, select Settings > Environment variables..
4. To add a single new environment variable, click on Add in the panel's top menu bar.
5. To use the JSON-based editor to manage environment variables, click Advanced edit.
